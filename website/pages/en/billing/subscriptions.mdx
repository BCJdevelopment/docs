## Subscriptions Overview

In addition to the [Pay As You Go](./pay-as-you-go) model that provides developers and data consumers more flexability in their payment options, The Graph also offers its users the option to pay for monthly queries at a fixed price. Subscriptions provide a more predictable billing experience while streamlining the user experience for query payments. 

The Graph's subscriptions offer data consumers a more trustless, low-risk approach to pay for queries. When setting up a subscription, data consumers deposit their funds in a subscription contract, which then drips to a service provider over the billing period. Unlike in web2, data consumers can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their subscriptions at any time and recoup a portion of their deposit based on the amount of time that has passed in the billing period. This system provides consumers more autonomy over controlling their projects' data by avoiding poor quality of service and vendor lock-ins.  

To get started with The Graph's subscriptions, start with these three easy steps: 

1. [Pick your subscription plan](#subscription-plans)
2. [Estimate your monthly query volume](#estimating-monthly-query-volume)
3. [Subscription payment methods](#subscription-payment-methods)

## Subscription Plans

**Consumer Plan:** Currently, The Graph only offers one subscription plan named the "Consumer Plan." This plan is optimized for data consumers that are locking in a fixed number of monthly queries at a flat price per query. Note that while the Consumer Plan does cover query costs for any Graph Network subgraph, all subgraphs still require curation signal to be indexed. Visit The Graph's [Curation docs to learn more about signaling on subgraphs](./network/curating/).

**Managing Subscriptions:** As detailed above, data consumers can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel their subscriptions at any time and recoup a portion of their deposit based on the amount of time that has passed in the billing period. Subscribers will also be able to renew their subscriptions half way through each month. Users can manage their subgraphs by clicking on the three dots in the top-right corner of the billing overview page. 

## Estimating Monthly Query Volume

### Existing users

When initiating a subscription on The Graph Network, a data consumer will need to know roughly how many queries they will use on a monthly basis. We recommend setting up a subscription that uses the highest number of monthly queries made over the past quarter with an additional 20-50% cusion to cover growth or unanticipated spikes in usage. 

If you don't know where to start on estimating your query volume, contact Edge & Node's Billing team at billing@edgeandnode.com for help with your anticipated query volume.

- **Existing Hosted Service and Pay As You Go users**: Existing hosted service and pay as you go users can contact Edge & Node's Billing team at billing@edgeandnode.com. The team can help advise consumers about anticipated query volume based on past usage on The Graph Network or hosted service.

- **Existing Subscription users**: Subscription users will be able to monitor their ongoing usage in their Billing Overview page where query usage will be available on a per minute, per month, and cumulative basis. All users will have up-to-date knowledge about their usage to hone the perfect subscription for their use case.

### New users

Users new to The Graph Network's subscriptions plans have a few options to estimate their monthly usage. 

- **Try Pay As You Go**: Another option for estimating your monthly queries is to add funds (e.g. 5,000 GRT) to your pay as you go billing balance and using this payment method for at least two weeks to establish your baseline query usage. After this trial period, you can setup a subscription based on your query volume during that time. We recommend adding an additional 20-50% to cover growth or unanticipated spikes in usage.

- **Estimate by concurrent users**: One option for setting up monthly queries is to estimate usage by finding the maximum number of concurrent users for your project and multiplying that figure by the page in your project making the most queries to The Graph. Barring any sharp spikes in growth, this estimate should establish a baseline that ensures no downtime. Of course, because of The Graph's subscriptions system, Consumers can easily upgrade or downgrade their subscription totals at any time throughout the month to adjust if this estimate isn’t quite right.



## Subscription Payment Methods

To pay for queries using subscriptions, you will need USDC on Arbitrum and an estimate of how many monthly queries your project will use:

- [Buying USDC on Arbitrum One](#buying-usdc-on-arbitrum-one)
- [Bridging USDC from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum One](#bridging-usdc-to-arbitrum-one)
- [Transferring USDC from a Centralized Exchange](#transferring-usdc-from-centralized-exchange)

### Buying USDC on Arbitrum One

1. Switch the network in your crypto wallet to Arbitrum One.

2. Transfer funds to your wallet to ensure you’ll have enough to purchased your desired amount of USDC as well as covering any gas fees.

3. Visit the [Uniswap app](https://app.uniswap.org/) and connect your wallet.

4. Ensure that you have the Arbitrum One network selected.

5. Once your wallet is connected, you'll be able to access the trading interface. Select the trading pair you want to use to purchase USDC. For example, if you have ETH, you can choose the ETH/USDC pair.

6. On the trading interface, you'll see various options to set up your trade. Specify the amount of ETH you want to swap for USDC or the amount of USDC you want to receive.

7. Before confirming the trade, double-check the details to ensure everything is correct. Take note of the estimated transaction cost, slippage tolerance, and gas fees. Once you're ready, click on the "Swap" button to proceed.

8. After confirming the transaction, you'll need to wait for the transaction to be processed and confirmed on the Arbitrum One network. This process may take a few moments. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive the USDC in your wallet.

9. Review your transaction on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/).

### Bridging USDC from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum One

1. Ensure you have USDC in your Ethereum mainnet wallet.

2. Connect your Ethereum mainnet wallet to the Arbitrum One network. You can do this by following the wallet provider's instructions for network configuration.

3. Once connected to Arbitrum One, navigate to the USDC token on your wallet interface.

4. Initiate a withdrawal or transfer of the desired amount of USDC from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One using a [bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). This process may involve specifying the recipient address on the Arbitrum One network.

5. Confirm the transaction and pay any associated fees. The USDC will be transferred from your Ethereum mainnet wallet to your Arbitrum One wallet.

6. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on both networks. The time required for confirmation may vary based on network congestion and other factors.

7. Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see the transferred USDC in your Arbitrum One wallet, ready to use.

### Transferring USDC from a Centralized Exchange to your Arbitrum One wallet  

1. Log in to your account on the centralized exchange where you currently hold your USDC.

2. Navigate to the withdrawal or funds transfer section of the exchange platform.

3. Search for USDC in the list of available cryptocurrencies for withdrawal.

4. Select USDC as the cryptocurrency you wish to withdraw.

5. Specify the amount of USDC you want to transfer from the centralized exchange to your wallet on Arbitrum One.

6. Provide the withdrawal destination address, which is your Arbitrum wallet address. Ensure you have correctly set up and configured your Arbitrum wallet beforehand.

7. Review the transaction details, including the withdrawal fee, if applicable, and verify that all information is accurate - especially the network (Arbitrum One).

8. Initiate the withdrawal request and confirm the transaction on the centralized exchange platform. This may involve completing any necessary security steps, such as two-factor authentication or email verification.

9. Wait for the withdrawal transaction to be processed and confirmed by the centralized exchange. The time required for confirmation may vary depending on the exchange's policies and blockchain congestion.

10. Once the withdrawal is complete, the USDC will be sent from the centralized exchange to your specified Arbitrum wallet address.

11. Monitor the transaction status on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) to ensure the transaction completes successfully. 

12. After the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you should see the transferred USDC in your Arbitrum wallet, ready for use on the Arbitrum One network.
