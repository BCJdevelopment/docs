## Plan FAQs

### What payment plans will be offered?

There are two payment plans:

- **Pay As You Go:** The Graph's original Prepaid Pay As You Go plan allows Consumers to pay for on-demand queries using GRT on Arbitrum or using a credit card via the Banxa on-ramp. All users can access the Pay As You Go system via the "Billing" tab in Subgraph Studio.

- **Consumer Plan:** The Consumer Plan will let Consumers lock in a set number of queries at a fixed monthly rate using USDC on Arbitrum. Subscription totals and pricing tiers can be viewed under the "Subscriptions" tab in Subgraph Studio.

### What is "Pay As You Go"?

The "Pay As You Go" plan refers to The Graph's original on-demand query payment system where Consumers pay with GRT or a credit card via the Banxa on-ramp. In contrast to The Graph's subscription plans where Consumers create a plan that has a set number of queries charged at a fixed rate over their billing cycle, the Pay As You Go plan provides Consumers the flexibility to add GRT to their billing balance without worrying that they will pay for queries that they will never use. The Pay As You Go system is perfect for new users that are still establishing a monthly query baseline or for projects with considerable query volatility. The major pitfall of Pay As You Go is that query prices change dynamically based on volume and market conditions, making monthly pricing much less predictable.

### Will there be a Free Plan?

In the coming months, core dev teams working on The Graph plans to offer a "Free Plan" to on-board new users to the ecosystem. The Free Plan will be designed for hobbyists and hackathoners to test out The Graph with low start-up costs and effort. 

## Subscriptions General FAQs

### Why is The Graph offering subscriptions?

Subgraph Studio will now offer The Graph’s consumers the capacity to lock in monthly queries at a fixed price. While Consumers still have access to the traditional "Pay As You Go" billing system to pay for on-demand queries through The Graph Network, subscriptions unlock a more streamlined and predictable pricing experience.

### How can I access The Graph's subscription system?

As of July 2023, The Graph's Subscriptions MVP billing system is currently in beta testing. A small group of users have been invited to participate in this beta test to ensure this new billing system meets the needs and standards of The Graph's most active developers. If you are interested in participating in the subscriptions beta program, please contact Edge & Node’s Billing team at [billing@edgeandnode.com](mailto:brandonkramer@edgeandnode.com).

### What is The Graph Subscription Protocol?

Subscriptions are made possible through The Graph's Subscription Protocol - a smart contract that handles payments between Data Providers and The Graph’s Consumers. The Graph Subscription Protocol enables users to deposit cryptocurrency for an agreement that a fixed number of queries will be served to the Consumer over the subscription period. Unlike traditional SaaS subscription models, the Consumer's deposit is added to a smart contract that drips at a fixed rate to the data provider over time on a per-block basis. This means that any Consumer that is unsatisfied with their quality of service can end their subscription at any time and withdraw the remaining portion of their initial deposit based on the amount of time that has passed during the billing period.

## Payment FAQs 

### How do I know how many queries I will need?

**Existing users:** When initiating a subscription on The Graph Network, a subscriber will need to know roughly how many queries they will use on a monthly basis. We recommend setting up a subscription that users the highest number of monthly queries used over the past quarter with an additional 20-50% to cover growth or unanticipated spikes in usage.

- **Existing Hosted Service and Pay As You Go users**: Existing hosted service and Pay As You Go users can contact Kyle Rojas on Telegram at @kyleArojas or reach out to our Billing team at billing@edgeandnode.com. We can help advise you about anticipated query volume based on past usage on The Graph Network or hosted service.

- **Existing Subscription users**: Subscription users will be able to monitor their ongoing usage in their Billing Overview page where query usage will be available on a per minute, per month, and cumulative basis. All users will have up-to-date knowledge about their usage to hone the perfect subscription for their use case.

**New users:** Users new to The Graph Network's subscriptions plans have a few options to estimate their monthly usage. 

- **Try Pay As You Go**: Another option for estimating your monthly queries is to add funds (e.g. 5,000 GRT) to your Pay As You Go billing balance and using this payment method for 2-4 weeks to establish your baseline for query usage. After this trial period, you can setup a subscription. We recommend adding an additional 20-50% to cover growth or unanticipated spikes in usage.

- **Estimate by concurrent users**: One option for setting monthly queries is to estimate usage by finding the maximum number of concurrent users for your project and multiplying that figure by the page in your project making the most queries to The Graph. Barring any sharp spikes in growth, this estimate should establish a baseline that ensures no downtime. Of course, because of The Graph's Subscription system, Consumers can easily upgrade or downgrade their subscription totals at any time throughout the month to adjust if this estimate isn’t quite right.

- **Reach out to our team**: Contact Kyle Rojas on Telegram at @kyleArojas or our Billing team at billing@edgeandnode.com for help in comparing your project to existing projects on The Graph. We can help advise you about anticipated query volume.

### What happens if I exceed my monthly query quota? 

When setting up a subscription, Consumers also establish a monthly quota. Once a monthly quota is surpassed, service providers will no longer respond to queries associated with the subscription’s query key. Fortunately, all Consumers will be able to upgrade to increase their monthly quota at any point during the billing period. This means that Consumers should never encounter down time as long as the monitor their monthly usage and upgrade their subscriptions when coming close to their monthly quotas.

### What happens if I exceed my rate limit? 

All subscriptions have both monthly quotas and rate limits that can be seen when setting up the subscription and monitored with the Billing Overview charts in Subgraph Studio. Consumers that surpass this rate limit will encounter service interruptions of approximately 10 minutes after each overage. Consumers looking to avoid these disruptions can upgrade their subscription to increase their both their rate limit along with their monthly quota. 

### How can I upgrade, downgrade, or cancel my account? 

You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time. After setting up a subscription in Subgraph Studio, you will be able to “Manage Plan” by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the Billing Overview page. Under the Manage Plan pane, you will see your usage during the current billing period as well as a recommended amount if you are at risk of running over. For those looking to end their current subscription, there will be a “Cancel Plan” option under the three dots in the top right corner of the Billing Overview page.

### How can I be notified if my application is close to running out of queries?

Notifications are enabled by default when setting up your subscription. Currently, we notify all users that they are risk of an overage when the surpass 90% of their monthly query quotas. 

### What currency will The Graph's subscription system accept?

As of June 2023, The Graph's Subscriptions system will accept USDC on Arbitrum. The Graph's "Pay As You Go" billing system accepts GRT on Arbitrum or credit card payments via Banxa.

### How can I acquire USDC on Arbitrum?

#### Option 1: Buying USDC on Arbitrum One

1. Switch the network in your crypto wallet to Arbitrum One.

2. Transfer funds to your wallet to ensure you’ll have enough to purchased your desired amount of USDC as well as covering any gas fees.

3. Visit the [Uniswap app](https://app.uniswap.org/) and connect your wallet.

4. Ensure that you have the Arbitrum One network selected.

5. Once your wallet is connected, you'll be able to access the trading interface. Select the trading pair you want to use to purchase USDC. For example, if you have ETH, you can choose the ETH/USDC pair.

6. On the trading interface, you'll see various options to set up your trade. Specify the amount of ETH you want to swap for USDC or the amount of USDC you want to receive.

7. Before confirming the trade, double-check the details to ensure everything is correct. Take note of the estimated transaction cost, slippage tolerance, and gas fees. Once you're ready, click on the "Swap" button to proceed.

8. After confirming the transaction, you'll need to wait for the transaction to be processed and confirmed on the Arbitrum One network. This process may take a few moments. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive the USDC in your wallet.

9. Review your transaction on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/).

#### Option 2: Bridging USDC from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum One

1. Ensure you have USDC in your Ethereum mainnet wallet.

2. Connect your Ethereum mainnet wallet to the Arbitrum One network. You can do this by following the wallet provider's instructions for network configuration.

3. Once connected to Arbitrum One, navigate to the USDC token on your wallet interface.

4. Initiate a withdrawal or transfer of the desired amount of USDC from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum One using a [bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). This process may involve specifying the recipient address on the Arbitrum One network.

5. Confirm the transaction and pay any associated fees. The USDC will be transferred from your Ethereum mainnet wallet to your Arbitrum One wallet.

6. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on both networks. The time required for confirmation may vary based on network congestion and other factors.

7. Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see the transferred USDC in your Arbitrum One wallet, ready to use.

#### Option 3: Transferring USDC from a Centralized Exchange to your Arbitrum One wallet  

1. Log in to your account on the centralized exchange where you currently hold your USDC.

2. Navigate to the withdrawal or funds transfer section of the exchange platform.

3. Search for USDC in the list of available cryptocurrencies for withdrawal.

4. Select USDC as the cryptocurrency you wish to withdraw.

5. Specify the amount of USDC you want to transfer from the centralized exchange to your wallet on Arbitrum One.

6. Provide the withdrawal destination address, which is your Arbitrum wallet address. Ensure you have correctly set up and configured your Arbitrum wallet beforehand.

7. Review the transaction details, including the withdrawal fee, if applicable, and verify that all information is accurate - especially the network (Arbitrum One).

8. Initiate the withdrawal request and confirm the transaction on the centralized exchange platform. This may involve completing any necessary security steps, such as two-factor authentication or email verification.

9. Wait for the withdrawal transaction to be processed and confirmed by the centralized exchange. The time required for confirmation may vary depending on the exchange's policies and blockchain congestion.

10. Once the withdrawal is complete, the USDC will be sent from the centralized exchange to your specified Arbitrum wallet address.

11. Monitor the transaction status on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/) to ensure the transaction completes successfully. 

12. After the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, you should see the transferred USDC in your Arbitrum wallet, ready for use on the Arbitrum One network.

Remember to verify the withdrawal address and double-check that you have selected the appropriate network (Arbitrum One) to avoid any accidental transfers to the wrong destination.

### Do subgraphs still need Curation signal? 

Yes, all subgraphs will require Curation signal regardless of the payment plan you have. While subscriptions are meant to provide predictable query prices, Indexers on The Graph Network still need to know that a subgraph is worth indexing and that communication happens through Curation signal on a subgraph. As of June 2023, subgraphs that have more than 4,000 GRT of signal are typically indexed while subgraphs with more than 10,000 GRT typically receive high quality of service. 

### Can I have multiple plans/subscriptions at one time?

During the Subscriptions Beta period, all Consumers will have access to both the Pay As You Go and Subscriptions billing systems with their web3 wallets. However, Consumers will only be able to setup one subscription per account. Those interested in managing multiple subscriptions at one time will only be able to do so using distinct web3 wallets. 

### When can I set up recurring payments?

As of July 2023, our Billing team is still developing a solution for recurring payments to be available in both our pay as you go and subscription plans. We recognize the importance of recurring payments on user experience and hope to offer this feature as soon as we can. 

## API + Query Key FAQs

### What is an API key?

An API key is a code used to identify and authenticate users so they can make queries to The Graph Network. API keys are tied to the [Pay As You Go payment system](https://www.notion.so/Subscription-MVP-FAQs-12aa70fbcc0a43aaaa377365ae9b6d5b?pvs=21) and can be added to either URL parameters or as a bearer authentication in your query request. 

To create an API key, Consumers will need to sign into Subgraph Studio using their web3 wallet, choose the “API keys” tab from the top menu, and click the “Create API key” button near the top right of the screen. 

To use an API key to make queries on The Graph Network, Consumers will need to choose the “Billing” tab from the top menu and then “Add GRT” to their billing balance. Currently, Pay As You Go accepts either GRT or credit card payments via the Banxa fiat on-ramp. 

Here is an example of how to make a query request using an API key:

```curl
# query with api key in bearer authorization (more secure)
curl https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
    -d '{"query": "{ _meta { block { number } } }"}'

# query with api key in query parameters (less secure)
curl https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/<API_KEY>/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"query": "{ _meta { block { number } } }"}'
```

For additional instructions on querying The Graph, see our [Query page](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/).

### What is a query key?

When creating a subscription on The Graph Subscription Protocol, a Consumer can generate a signed message using their web3 wallet called a “query key”. Like an API key, a query key authenticates Consumers when making queries. Unlike API keys, however, query keys must always be added to requests using the bearer authentication method. Importantly, query keys cannot be accessed in Subgraph Studio unless a Consumer signs in with their web3 wallet. While multisig support is not currently implemented, there are plans to add this feature soon. Please keep in mind that any time changes are made to your subscription account or security settings, the query key will need to be regenerated.

Here is an example of how to make a query request using an query key:

```curl
# query with api key in bearer authorization
curl https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/subgraphs/id/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <QUERY_KEY>" \
    -d '{"query": "{ _meta { block { number } } }"}'
```

### How are API keys and query keys different? 

API keys and query keys both authenticate users when they make requests to the network.

- **API keys:** API keys correspond to the Pay As You Go system, can be accessed in Subgraph Studio without signing a message with your web3 wallet, and API keys can be added either directly to the URL parameters or the bearer authentication of a query request.

- **Query keys:** Query keys can be generated at any time, but only become active after the creation of a subscription. Query keys can only be added as the bearer authentication and not the URL parameters of a query request. 

API keys and query keys serve the same function of authenticating users that make requests to The Graph Network. The biggest difference is that API keys correspond to the Pay As You Go system, can be accessed in Subgraph Studio without signing a message with your web3 wallet, and API keys can be added either directly to the URL parameters or the bearer authentication of a query request. On the other hand, query keys can be generated at any time but only become active after the creation of a subscription and query keys can only be added as the bearer authentication and not the URL parameters of a query request. 

### Where can I see my API/query key usage?

API key and query key usage can be viewed in Subgraph Studio. To view your API key usage trends, go to Subgraph Studio, choose “Billing” from the top menu, and view your query fee usage in the Overview tab.

To view your query key usage, you will need to be included in the subscriptions beta program. Once you have been included in this group and started a subscription, you can go to Subgraph Studio, choose “Subscriptions” from the top menu, and view your query usage from one of the three charts available in the Subscriptions MVP.

### How can I prevent my monthly quota from being used up by third parties?

Your subscription is tied to your query key, which works much like an API key. However, unlike API keys, your query keys must be added to requests using the bearer authentication method. Adding query keys to your auth header, rather than the URL, means that your query keys are protected by some level of encryption. 

For users that want to add an extra layer of protection, we recommend users go to the security settings under the “Keys” tab in Subgraph Studio. There, you can limit your query key to use by specific domains or subgraphs.

### Will I be able to control which subgraphs my subscription is used for?

Yes, you can control both the domains and subgraphs your subscription query key is used with. By default, your subscription query key can be used in any subgraph published on The Graph’s Ethereum or Arbitrum deployment networks. Just like with The Graph’s API keys, all query keys have security settings that users can limit to specific domains or subgraphs. This functionality can be accessed by adjusting the security settings for your query key under the “Keys” tab in Subgraph Studio.
