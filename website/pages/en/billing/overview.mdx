There are two ways to pay for queries on The Graph Network:

1. [Pay as you go](./pay-as-you-go-billing): pay for queries as you make them using either [GRT on Arbitrum](./pay-as-you-go#billing-on-arbitrum) or [Banxa](./pay-as-you-go#billing-with-banxa)
2. [Subscription](./subscription-billing): pay a fixed monthly fee for a fixed number of queries

## Pay as you go

Historically, data consumers on The Graph have used the pay as you go billing model to pay for query fees. This model allows you to pay for queries using GRT. The GRT is added to your account balance on the [billing contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1b07d3344188908fb6deceac381f3ee63c48477a), and used to pay for queries associated with your API keys.

## Subscription

The subscription billing model allows you to pay a fixed monthly fee for a fixed number of queries. This model is currently in beta, and is only available to a limited number of data consumers. If you are interested in using the subscription billing model, please [contact us](mailto:
