title: Billing Overview

There are two ways to pay for queries on The Graph Network:

1. [Pay as you go](./pay-as-you-go): Pay for queries as you make them using either [GRT on Arbitrum](./pay-as-you-go#billing-on-arbitrum) or [Banxa](./pay-as-you-go#billing-with-banxa)

2. [Subscriptions](./subscriptions): Pay a fixed monthly fee for a fixed number of queries

## Pay As You Go

Historically, The Graph's data consumers have used the pay as you go billing model to cover for query fees. This model allows you to pay for queries using GRT, which is added to a consumer's account balance on the [billing contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1b07d3344188908fb6deceac381f3ee63c48477a), and used to pay for queries associated with your API keys.

## Subscriptions (Beta)

The subscription billing model allows you to pay a fixed monthly fee for a fixed number of queries. As of July 2023, this model is in beta, and is only available to a limited number of data consumers. The subscriptions model allows consumers to pay for queries using USDC on Arbitrum, which is added to the the [subscriptions contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x6e4584820da058850ed523008f6f0e3aebce16f5), and used to pay for queries associated with your query keys.
