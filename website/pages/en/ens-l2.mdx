title: How to display your ENS domain on Arbitrum One
---

Due to growing demand, The Graphâ€™s protocol moved from Ethereum to Arbitrum One to take advantage of lower gas fees and faster transaction times.

Many Indexers have begun transferring their indexing operations, but some have encountered a problem: the ENS domain does not show up correctly in The Graph Explorer on Arbitrum One. The reason for this is that the ENS name that was assigned to the Safe Global multisig on Ethereum does not have the same address as the Safe Global multisig on Arbitrum One.

The solution is to create an ENS subname that functions as your ENS name on Ethereum and then apply your old name to the Arbitrum wallet.

> Note: this tutorial assumes the ENS name is owned by a multi-sig wallet on Ethereum mainnet.

## Step 1: Create New ENS Subnames

- Access the **Safe Global dapp**.
- Click on the **Apps** option on the lefthand side.
- Select the **ENS - Ethereum Naming Service** option from the Apps menu.

## Step 2: Manage Your ENS Names

- The ENS app will appear in your Safe Global account.
- Choose **My Names** from the top-right menu.

## Step 3: Select Your Domain

- View all of your names and click on the domain you want to create subnames for.

## Step 4: Create Subnames

- Navigate to **Subnames** in the top menu.
- Click the **+ New Subname** button.

## Step 5: Add Subnames

- Enter the subnames you want to add. For example:
  - `ethereum.example.eth`
  - `ops.example.eth`
- Sign the transactions for each new name added. This may require hard wallet signatures depending on your setup.

## Step 6: Add Subnames to Arbitrum Wallet

- For the ENS domain you would like displayed on Arbitrum, change the resolver address to your Arbitrum wallet address.
- Update the resolver address of your wallet on Ethereum mainnet to reflect the desired ENS domain.
  - If your resolver address is already set on Ethereum mainnet, you do not need to change it.
