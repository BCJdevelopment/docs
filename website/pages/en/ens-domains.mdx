title: Managing ENS Names
---

The Graph's transition from Ethereum to Arbitrum One has led to reduced gas fees for Indexers. However, this shift has introduced challenges in maintaining consistent ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names across these two networks.

This guide provides a step-by-step approach for Indexers to address this issue effectively.

## Proposed Solution

To resolve the ENS name recognition challenge, Indexers need to create a new subname for their Ethereum operations and set up a new operations multisig. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Creation of a New Subname

1. **Choose a New Subname**:

   - Decide on a new subname, such as `ethereum.example.eth`, which will represent your Ethereum Mainnet operations.

2. **Register the Subname**:

   - Go to an ENS domain service provider (like [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains/)).
   - Search for `ethereum.example.eth` to ensure it's available.
   - Follow the provider's process to register the subname.

3. **Link the Subname to Your Ethereum Address**:
   - After registration, link the new subname (`ethereum.example.eth`) to your Ethereum Mainnet address.
   - This can typically be done through the same ENS service provider's interface.

### Step 2: Setting Up a New Operations Multisig

1. **Create a Multisig Wallet**:

   - Use a multisig wallet service like Gnosis Safe.
   - Follow their guide to create a new multisig wallet.
   - Add designated individuals (e.g., Orjan and Yuval) as signatories.

2. **Assign an ENS Name to the Multisig**:

   - Choose a name such as `ops.example.eth` for the multisig.
   - Register this name following the same process as in Step 1.
   - Link this name to your new multisig wallet address.

3. **Configure the Multisig**:
   - Set up security configurations and threshold settings for transaction approvals.
   - Test the multisig with a small transaction to ensure it's functioning as expected.

### Expected Outcome

Upon completing these steps, your operations will benefit from:

- **Distinct ENS Names**:
  - `ethereum.example.eth` for Ethereum Mainnet operations.
  - `ops.example.eth` for day-to-day transactions.

These distinct ENS names will maintain consistency and recognition across Ethereum and Arbitrum One networks, effectively resolving the issues previously encountered on the Graph Explorer.
