title: Subgraph Migration to The Graph Network FAQs
---

## Migration Process Questions

### 1. Will the hosted service continue to support [xyz chain] until the decentralized network is able to adequately support [xyz chain]?

Yes, hosted service support for each chain will continue until each respective chain has been on the decentralized network for a number of months, giving subgraph developers enough time to migrate to the decentralized network.

### 2. Will all functionalities from the hosted service be functional on the decentralized network?

Yes, the decentralized network will provide all core functionalities of the hosted service with the added benefit of being powered by 165+ independently operated and geographically distributed Indexers. This enables a robust, reliable, and resilient network with no centralized points of failure.

### 3. What are the steps to migrate?

Deploy the subgraph to Subgraph Studio Publish the subgraph & signal (curate) with GRT on the network to attract Indexers ~10K GRT signal is recommended for the best Indexer experience Create an API key in the studio and fill it with GRT (on Polygon)

### 4. How do I create an API Key?

You can create an API Key in Subgraph Studio‚Äôs [API Key section](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/).

Migrate the API endpoint from the hosted service to the decentralized network after the subgraph gets indexed by multiple Indexers In order to migrate your API endpoint, visit [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).    

### 5. Is there a migration guide I can use for this process?

Read through the process in the step-by-step [migration guide blog](https://thegraph.com/blog/how-to-migrate-ethereum-subgraph). Watch this [step-by-step video](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

### 6. When will the hosted service be deprecated?

The hosted service will sunset for chains supported on the decentralized network by the end of Q1 2023. Hosted service support for chains not on The Graph‚Äôs decentralized network will continue until those chains are supported by The Graph‚Äôs decentralized network.

### 7. Why should I migrate now?

**Grant Eligibility**: If you migrate soon, you are eligible for a GRT grant to help curate your subgraph and help pay for initial query fees. Apply for a migration grant [here](https://thegraph.typeform.com/to/Zz8UAPri?typeform-source=thegraph.com).

**Marketing Support**: Migrated dapps are eligible for prioritized marketing campaigns like these Twitter threads: examples [1](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/status/1496891582401814537), [2](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/status/1491926128302379008), & [3](https://twitter.com/graphprotocol/status/1491126245396201473).

Also, if you‚Äôd like to do a live migration at a conference to showcase your project(s) and how you use The Graph, please [reach out](http://migration@thegraph.foundation)!

**Tech Support**: Direct channel to engineers from Edge & Node and the community to help every step of the way.

### 8. If I don‚Äôt want to (or can‚Äôt) signal 10K GRT on my subgraph right away‚Äîhow do I attract Curators?

It is best to put at least some GRT signal down to build trust If you do not have the funds to signal yourself, 
please reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uvq4aazv) about the GRT migration grant program Let the community know about your subgraph‚Äôs curation need in the [#üôãÔ∏±curators‚Äù channel in Discord](http://thegraph.com/discord).

### 9. Is there anything I should do with my hosted service subgraph after I migrate to the network?

Hiding your hosted service subgraph is strongly recommended. [This video](https://www.loom.com/share/7cffd2a7845e4fbd8c51f45c516cb7f9) walks through the process.

### 10. How to switch the subgraph API in the front end?

As soon as the first Indexer has fully indexed your subgraph you can start to query the subgraph on the decentralized network.

In order to retrieve the query URL for your subgraph, you can copy/paste it by clicking on the symbol next to the query URL. You will see something like this:

`https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/S9ihna8D733WTEShJ1KctSTCvY1VJ7gdVwhUujq4Ejo`

**Important**: Make sure to replace [api-key] with an actual API key generated in the Subgraph Studio [API Key section](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/). After this, you will be able to use that Query URL in your dapp to send your GraphQL requests to.

## Query Fees & API Keys/Billing

### 11. How much do queries cost?

For the month of July 2022, the average price per query fee cost ranged from $0.00017-$0.00031, though this varies depending on volume, as there is a volume discount, so prices can vary above and below the range mentioned.

### 12. What is our expected cost per month?

If you‚Äôd like an estimate of what your query costs would be based on existing volume, please ask Edge & Node team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uvq4aazv).

### 13. What happens if the price of GRT rises?

The free market system enables GRT to float up and down, without necessarily increasing query prices in USD. If Indexers don‚Äôt adjust their query prices in USD to attract query fees and to serve users, then they will not be selected. All Indexers are competing for query fees, as opposed to one organization acting as a single price maker.

Consumer prices are pegged in USD. Indexers have the option to do so in USD as well. As Indexers set minimum query costs, users can set max query costs, and the protocol is becoming better at finding an equilibrium that suits both Indexers and users.

Learn how to [set a max query budget](https://thegraph.com/docs/es/deploying/subgraph-studio/#managing-your-api-keys).

### 14. Do I risk being invoiced for an unexpectedly large sum of GRT on the decentralized network?

Although highly unlikely, if an unauthorized user gains access to your API key, they may use it maliciously. Subgraph developers are encouraged to follow best practices for safety and security, as well as restricting the API key by both **subgraph** and **domain** in the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/).

### 15. How do I set a max query budget?

You can set a max query budget in the Subgraph Studio [API Key section](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys/), under the Budget tab.

Watch [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/b5fc533e48584cb694017392c80c75e0) for an overview of that process, as well as adjusting other parts of your API Key.

Please note that setting your max query budget too low will exclude Indexers, potentially leading to poor quality service in the form of failed queries, slow queries, etc.

As of July 2022, it‚Äôs best to keep in the $0.0003-$0.0005 range as the lowest max query budget. If you‚Äôre curious about the most updated range of max query fees with good QoS, please ask the Edge & Node team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uvq4aazv).

### 16. How are query price minimums/maximums set by both users/consumers and Indexers?

Consumer prices are pegged in USD. Indexers have the option to set a minimum & maximize, the same way consumers can.

### 17. How do I fill up my API Key to pay for query fees?

You can fill up your [billing balance](https://thegraph.com/studio/billing/) in the Subgraph Studio Billing Dashboard by pressing the ‚ÄúAdd GRT‚Äù button.

[This video](https://www.loom.com/share/a81de6ef11d64c62872ea210c58c6af5) has an overview of that process.

### 18. How do I check my API Key Balance?

There are two ways to check your billing balance: The easiest is to set a billing alert email address [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/settings/). You can also query the [billing subgraph directly](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/graphprotocol/billing?query=Nena%20account).

## Using The Network

### 19. Is there a cost to upgrade my subgraph?

Yes, there is a cost to upgrade a subgraph equal to 1% of the total curation signal when a developer upgrades a subgraph. The 1% is split evenly between Curators (0.5%) and Subgraph Developers (0.5%)

The tax is to mitigate the ‚ÄúSubgraph Withholding Attack‚Äù as described in [GIP-0013](https://hackmd.io/s3Fim2M8RxqWRLZ_8APuUg#Appendix-A---Subgraph-Withholding-Attack).

### 20. How do I speed up sync time?

Minimize the use of smart contract calls within the subgraph. Accessing a smart contract state requires an eth_call to the RPC, which can slow down sync times.

Contact the Edge & Node team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uvq4aazv) to see if there are any other ways to help solve the issue.

### 21. How do I prevent a DDoS attack?

The best practice is to restrict the API key by both subgraph and domain in the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/). Here is what that looks like:

![Subgraph Studio Restrict API Access](/img/subgraph-studio-restrict-api-access.png)

Talk to the Edge & Node team if you have more specific needs like rate limiting.

Soon, with the implementation of a zero knowledge cryptographic advancement by Semiotic Labs and Edge & Node called [Shellproofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2X7D-hxVtQ), payment should be facilitated by state channels directly between the users and the Indexers but there is more research needed.

### 22. How long do queries take?

Queries take an average of 150-400 milliseconds on the decentralized network. For context, 100ms is usually considered to be indistinguishable from immediate.

### 23. Is there Multisig support in Subgraph Studio as I migrate?

Yes, multisig support has recently been added, allowing the multisig wallet to own the subgraph as opposed to an individual. You can find more information [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/studio/multisig).

### 24. What are the contract addresses for GRT on ETH & Polygon? And how much should I buy of each?

ETH: `0xc944E90C64B2c07662A292be6244BDf05Cda44a7`

Recommend 10K for curation.

Polygon: `0x5fe2B58c013d7601147DcdD68C143A77499f5531`

Many projects keep 30-60 days worth of GRT in their API key so they don‚Äôt need to refill often.

To understand what your 30-60 day GRT fees would be, please reach out to the Edge & Node team on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uvq4aazv).

Subscriptions and fiat onramp services are being worked on, though they are not functional yet.

## Hosted Service Deprecation

### 25. What chains/networks are enabled on The Graph‚Äôs decentralized network?

Ethereum is available with more networks coming soon.

### 26. When will the hosted service deprecate?

For network-enabled subgraphs, the timeline is:

**End of Q3 2022**: New subgraph deployments on the hosted service will be disabled for chains adequately supported by the decentralized network.

**End of Q4 2022**: Updates to hosted service subgraphs will be disabled for subgraphs on chains adequately supported on the decentralized network.

**End of Q4 2023**: The hosted service will cease all support of subgraphs for chains that are adequately supported on the decentralized network.

### 27. What happens if the hosted service is deprecated and the chain I‚Äôm using isn‚Äôt integrated yet?

Once the decentralized network enables support for a chain, then the hosted service deprecation timeline will start, in this order:

- End of month 1 after integration: no new subgraph deployments on the hosted service

- End of month 2: no subgraph upgrades on the hosted service

- End of month 3: chain deprecation on the hosted service, where the network-enabled chain‚Äôs subgraphs will be archived/deleted
